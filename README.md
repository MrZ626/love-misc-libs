love-misc-libs
==============

love-misc-libs is a collection of libraries written by me that are either small,
or collected here for legacy reasons. Documentation for a subset of these can
be found [here][docs].

Current projects
----------------

A couple of the projects here are outdated and deprecated, the following is a
list of projects that are still current:

- async <sup>1</sup>
- inifile <sup>1</sup>
- LUBE <sup>1</sup>
- repler
- SECL
- SoundManager

Note that not all of them have underwent recent testing, but I will respond to
bugfixes in these projects.
